A real mess to configure CREO 

The less you put into a config file the faster CREO loads. If CREO used the setting you want as default you do not need to have it in a config.pro.
Unless it is an option you want locked in config.sup

Creo config load order
1.<Loadpoint/install dir> config.sup [Options set here are locked from later edits. Recommend company wide settings here that are static regardless of site/work assignment]
2.<Loadpoint/install dir> config.pro [Options set here are recommended to be site or work assignment specific.
                                      Launch script to replace config.pro with correct version at launch if you have multiple site configs. Corp mapkey go here]  
3.<C:\Users\%username%\> config.pro (if present) [Recommended use is for users mapkeys]
4.<Creo start in directory> config.pro (if present) [Recommended use is for users config options]
